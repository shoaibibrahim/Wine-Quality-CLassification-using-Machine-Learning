# Wine-Quality-CLassification-using-Machine-Learning
Here we have used the Red Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle.
The quality of the wine has been determined based on 11 chemical properties of wine. 
To determine its quality, the score of the wine is set from a score from 1 to 10.
We have used five differnet classficiation algorithm to perform the classification.
The daaset went through rigorous pre processing before being fed into our models.
The accuracy, f1 scores have been measured.
